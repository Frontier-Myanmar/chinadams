The CDZ region has the second highest population density in Myanmar but remains one of the least developed. Access and availability of water resources are key determinants of rural poverty with livelihoods largely dependent on the southwest monsoon. Principal crops in the CDZ consist of oil seeds and legumes, chillies, and vegetables grown as rainfed, upland crops during the wet season. Rice cultivation depends on irrigation, even during the monsoon season.

The project has five components. The first component will support developing systems and procedures for capturing more revenues from natural resource sectors on-budget and addressing identified weaknesses in tax administration. This component will be closely linked to government implementation of the extractive industries transparency initiative and will support the development of the business processes and corresponding reporting and recording systems to move revenues on-budget. The second component is aimed at supporting the new mandates of the budget and planning departments and the evolving decentralization process in Myanmar. To help inform decisions and debate on budgetary allocations, this component will also work towards improving the quality and timeliness of information available both internally and externally through basic computerization of current manual compilation process for the current and investment budgets. The third component, support for effective budget execution will focus on the establishment and effective operationalization of the treasury department, creating an effective procurement function, and building the ability of Myanmar Economic Bank (MEB) to manage the state fund account in order to ensure business continuity in view of the Central Bank of Myanmar (CBM) separation from the Ministry of Finance (MOF). The fourth component will strengthen Myanmar's nascent structures for external oversight and accountability and thus complement improvements in the quality and transparency of budgetary information. It has following two sub-components: (i) supporting the parliamentary public accounts committee; and (ii) enhancing operational effectiveness of the auditor general's office. The fifth component aims to address the specific challenges faced by Myanmar with respect to the skills required to operate a modern public financial management system.

DRRD plans the rehabilitation of the selected roads, issues tenders for the various construction projects, reviews the bids and awards the contracts. The programme is designed as a “learning-by-doing” project. Experts accompany the staff of the DRRD so that they can learn how to implement international projects.

MM-FERD-ID3576,Private Sector Development in Myanmar (PSD I),"The general election in November 2015 was the culmination of a multilayer reform process that Myanmar had initiated since the country’s opening up in 2011. Given that just under 26% of the population lives below the subsistence level, private sector development and trade promotion as instruments of poverty reduction continue to be priorities for the new government. However, the government lacks the institutional, political and technical capacity to improve framework conditions (legislation, regulations, strategies) for the private sector. Micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) in particular lack the necessary services and promotional opportunities to make use of the market opportunities in various sectors for expanding their business. As a result, the current economic system is still unable to offer adequate potential for income, employment and participation for the members of the various ethnic and other groups.
 
Since October 2012, the Myanmar-German Private Sector Development Project (PSD) promotes sustainable private sector development and broad-based job-creation by strengthening the institutional, political and technical framework conditions and capacities. In order to support local economic development on the ground, the project opened its first branch office in Shan State’s capital Taunggyi in mid-2013. 

With the start of its second implementation phase in October 2016, the project is active in six fields of activity: (1) capacity development for MSMEs; (2) demand-oriented services for MSMEs; (3) improved framework conditions for MSMEs; (4) trade policy and opportunities; (5) trade facilitation; (6) quality infrastructure and standards. It concentrates on assisting MSMEs with interventions at the political level (relevant ministries, macro level), the meso level (institutions promoting the private sector) and the local level (SME and NGO, micro level). The regional focus is on Shan State, with the exception of interventions with a national component (e.g. policy advice) and where tackling obstacles in the sector or value chain requires a different focus.","The project aims at improving the framework conditions and services available for sustainable growth of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and small producers in selected sectors. 

More specifically, the objectives for the six fields of activity are as follows:
- Field of activity (1) ‘Capacity development for MSMEs’ aims at improving the capacity of MSMEs in selected sectors, e.g. in terms of access to market and price information, product quality and services and access to finance and markets, etc.
- The core element of field of activity (2) ‘Demand-oriented services for MSMEs’ is the quantitative and qualitative improvement of services for MSMEs and small producers in Myanmar.
- Field of activity (3) ‘Improved framework conditions for MSMEs’ aims to increase the capacity of regional and national state authorities to shape framework conditions and economic promotion for selected sectors and regions in the interests of a  social and ecological market economy.
- Field of activity (4) 'Trade policy and opportunities’ aims at improving the capacity of public and private actors to shape the process of trade policy reform.
- Field of activity (5) ‘Trade facilitation’ aims at improving procedures and processes in customs administration for goods imports and exports.
- Field of activity (6) ‘Quality infrastructure and standards’ aims at bringing the quality infrastructure and sanitary and phytosanitary standards (SPS) for selected sectors up to EU standards.",Small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) development,Job Creation Sector Coordination Group,Completion,Bilateral,Project-type interventions,Grant,19750000,13150027,24436166.34,15225703.76,100,24436166.34,15225703.76,10,Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit,Government of Germany,,Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit,Ministry of Commerce| Ministry of Planning and Finance| Ministry of Industry,Nation-wide - 60.00% | Shan State - 40.00%,Taunggyi - 40.00%,2012-10-01,2018-12-31,2012-10-01,2017-09-30,Mr. Tobias Stolz,,psd-myanmar@giz.de,,False,

This work will increasingly target areas where the conflict has continued to persist or expand, including Shan, Kachin, Rakhine and parts of the South East. A stronger emphasis will be placed on developing relationships and reporting channels in non-governmental controlled areas, as engagement with listed armed groups on use and recruitment advances and access to non-governmental controlled areas increases. Information management will be strengthened to capture all grave violations against children is critical, both for engagement with all parties to the conflict, and for evidence based effective advocacy. Adolescents who have been affected by armed conflict will be further engaged. Through their voices, and linked with the peace process, adolescents can ensure that the issues they face are considered in the peace dialogue. Utilizing its convening role, UNICEF will continue to co-chair the national mine risk working group alongside the Department of Social Welfare, and support the decentralized State working group structures that have been established in Kachin, Shan, Kayin and Kayah. Leveraging relationships with the national army there will be a continued effort to bridge mine action NGOs with evolving plans to begin the process of mine clearance. The mine risk working group is proving to be an effective entry point to begin these sensitive discussions both with the national armed forces and non-state armed groups. It is envisaged that clearance is likely to begin in the South East. Coordination with UNMASS, UNDP and the Peace Joint Monitoring Committee will be enhanced to ensure that UN support to mine action is appropriately aligned with the national structures that are already in place. UNICEF will continue to provide leadership in behaviour change to promote knowledge and safe practice towards landmines/ERW. This will include standardization of tools and training as well as specific considerations on gender and diversity, including analysis on the distinct mobility patterns/exposure to risk by sex and age.","By 2022, key civil society groups and Government actors have improved capacity to monitor grave violations against children and risks related to land mines/ERW and advocate for prevention and accountability of parties to conflict.","Multisector aid for basic social services(50.00%),Child soldiers (Prevention and demobilisation)(50.00%)",Social Protection and Disaster Management Sector Coordination Group,Implementation,Multilateral,Project-type interventions,Grant,1576441.01,0,1576441.01,0,1521,1576441.01,0,39,United Nations Children's Fund,United Nations Development Programme| United Nations Office of Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs| DFAT - Australian Aid Program| Government of Germany| Government of Japan| UNICEF Core Resources| European Union| United Nations Children's Fund| U.S. Agency for International Development| Humanitarian Aid Office of the European Commission,United Nations Children's Fund,Save the Children - Myanmar| World Vision| Karuna Myanmar Social Services,"Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement",Nation-wide - 100.00%,,2018-01-01,2022-12-31,2018-01-01,,Paul Edwards,Tel: +95 (0) 1230 5960-5969 ext 1427,pedwards@unicef.org,,False,

MM-FERD-ID8399,Financial Sector Development in Myanmar (FSD I),The aim of the project is to strengthen Myanmar's banking sector with a special focus on financial services for small and medium-sized enterprises.,"Since Myanmar began to open up in 2011, the country has been reforming its economic policies with the aim of establishing a market-oriented economy. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) play a key role in this kind of sustainable economic development. In Myanmar, most private companies are also SMEs. They are extremely important for the labour market.

The lack of access to adequate financial services is one of the main obstacles to growth for SMEs. The financial sector overall is in urgent need of development and is also ill-adapted to the needs of SMEs. Sustainable financial services that meet the needs of SMEs do not exist. This is largely a consequence of the prohibitive regulation of the banking sector and institutional deficiencies of the commercial banks which prevent the creation of SME-oriented services.

The overall regulatory and operating conditions of the financial sector have been improved; demand-driven financial services have been provided for SMEs.

The project works on three levels to ensure that SMEs will be able to drive economic growth and social development in Myanmar:

Assistance will be given to the central bank in designing adequate regulatory and supervisory conditions.

Human resources development in the banking sector will be strengthened by supporting training service providers.

MM-FERD-ID8104,TVET Reform Programme,"High school graduates, teachers and instructors at TVET institutions","The ""Vocational Education Reform Programme Myanmar"" includes the modernisation and expansion of TVET institutes. As part of a comprehensive schooling approach, three institutes in Yangon benefit from the measures in the first phase. These are the Government Technical Institute (GTI) Insein, the GTI Shwepyithar and the Government Technical High School (GTHS) Ywarma.

All three centres are in close proximity to an industrial area, which is a good prerequisite for designing a demand-oriented education. In the second phase, the reform programme will be expanded to schools in Mandalay. In later phases, more institutes will be involved.

Concrete measures include the acquisition of modern training equipment as well as small constructional measures in the buildings. Furthermore, as part of the accompanying measure,  teachers are trained. They get to know the private sector, in order to make best use of the technical equipment for educational purposes. In addition, the curricula of the individual institutes are geared to each other, which will facilitate a smooth transition for the GTHS graduates to the GTIs.

The first programme phase further includes the installation of a photovoltaic system for the ""Industrial Training Centre"" in Sinde. This school was supported with technical equipment as part of a previous project. The power supply has deteriorated significantly and is no longer permanently guaranteed. The measure represents a cost-effective and sustainable power source and assures training on the job for the students.

The Ministry of Education (MoE) is the main cooperation partner of KfW Development Bank. The Department for Technical and Vocational Education and Training (DTVET) is responsible for the programme implementation. The Ministry of Industry (MoI) is responsible for the installation of the photovoltaic system in Sinde.

Central to the overall reform process have been peace initiatives, under which the government has brokered 13 ceasefire agreements with armed ethnic groups since late 2011. 

These agreements, each individually negotiated, must now be consolidated into lasting political settlements, as well as arrangements established for development in former conflict areas.

MM-FERD-ID4146,Project for Construction of New Thaketa Bridge,"The objective of the Project is to enhance transportation between east part of Yangon and southeast part of Yangon by replacing a bridge which is a bottleneck of the transportation, thereby contributing for economic development and improvement of people's livelihoods.","This project will replace the Thaketa Bridge that crosses Pazundaung Creek in Yangon, increasing the traffic capacity of the bridge and alleviating congestion, which will make goods and traveler transportation more efficient on the road network connecting the eastern and southeastern parts of Yangon. 

The road network in Yangon is separated at many points by the city’s waterways which are crossed by 15 bridges. The Thaketa Bridge, a two-lane road 284 meters in length and 8.5 meters wide, was constructed in 1966 and is one such bridge, providing convenient access across Pazundaung Creek on a route connecting the city center of Yangon and Thaketa and districts further east. 

In 2013, the bridge handled approximately 29,000 vehicles per day, a volume resulting in chronic congestion as there is only one lane in each direction. As the traffic volume is expected to increase with further economic development in the greater Yangon metropolitan area, solving traffic congestion along with safety concerns due to deteriorating roads and ensuring safety for pedestrians with separated sidewalks are priorities.

In advance of this project, JICA provided assistance to conduct the Project for Comprehensive Urban Transport Plan of the Greater Yangon, for formulating a master plan that includes a road network, public transportation and transportation management with a goal of 2035. Construction of the new Thaketa Bridge was proposed as a priority project in the master plan to strengthen the road network of the future. 

A transit point to the Thilawa Special Economic Zone, a new industrial zone in the southeast part of Yangon where development work has commenced, the Thaketa Bridge is a key junction tying together the Thaketa district, the Yangon district and Yangon International Airport, and is positioned as a major roadway for the future. 

This project will increase the traffic capacity of the Thaketa Bridge and safety access for pedestrians, shortening the travel time for goods and travelers, which is expected to both reduce transportation costs and improve the living environment of local residents. In addition, the smoother flow of people and goods over this bridge is expected to contribute to the economic development of the Yangon metropolitan area and Myanmar overall.",Transport and storage,Transport and ICT Sector Coordination Group,Implementation,Bilateral,Project-type interventions,Grant,4200000000,0,41269662,0,1,41269662,0,1,Government of Japan,Government of Japan,,Japan International Co-operation Agency,Ministry of Construction,Yangon Region - 100.00%,,2014-06-05,2019-12-31,2014-06-05,,Economic & ODA Section,01-549644~8 ,eco@yn.mofa.go.jp,,False,

MM-FERD-ID2622,Promoting Rural Electrification through Mini-grids (RE),State and private sector organizations active in the mini grid / off grid area of rural electrification,"The overall objective of the project is: State and private sector actors use enhanced technical and structural capacity to improve framework conditions for and to plan and implement rural electrification. 
To achieve this, the project operates at the national level, advising the relevant recipients on the union level, and also sub-nationally in Shan State for its implementation, and focuses on the off-grid part of rural electrification using decentralised village power plants (Mini-grids).
For achieving this objective, the project focuses on 4 central Fields of Action: 
Development of Policy and Regulatory Framework Conditions - The project will advise the state actors primarily at the Department of Rural Development (DRD) to design the fundamental policy and regulatory frameworks in order to stimulate private investments in Mini-grids. During this process, an active engagement with private sector will be facilitated, in order to design the framework conditions for rural electrification reflecting the market experience and interests. 
Specific activities in this area may include: 
- Support the development of rules and regulations (incl. technical specification/ grid codes) for interconnection of mini grids into the national grid 
 - Provide state of the art tools for cost/benefit analysis of different rural electrification technologies and approaches 
- Assisting the DRD in formulating and implementing a gender mainstreaming plan for rural electrification
 - Support GIS based energy resource assessment in Shan State

 Human Capacity Development - Alongside to the advisory service, the project will strengthen the competence of the government officials in effective planning and administration of rural electrification, with a specific focus on Mini-grids. Training activities in areas of gender mainstreaming, technology, administration, management, and business and operator models for effective promotion of the market-based approaches in rural electrification are planned in Shan State.
Specific activities in this area may include: 
- Conduct technical and administrative trainings for DRD staff on union and esp. Shan State level
 - Organize business and technical trainings for renewable energy companies
 - Support training institutions in educating village electricians
 
Quality & Innovation - The project will provide a platform for national and international exchange on innovative concepts for off-grid electrification and associated approaches to quality assurance. This will require showcasing concrete model projects for off-grid electricity supply that could serve as examples applicable in Myanmar's off-grid rural electrification and installing at least two pilot projects of innovative village electricity systems. 
Specific activities in this are may include: 
- Facilitate the implementation of showcase projects based on innovative technologies and business models 
- Introduce a “mini grid service package” to facilitate quality issues in mini grid installations, operations, management and maintenance 
- Support quality-awareness campaigns for electricity users
 
Private Sector Participation - Throughout the project implementation period, an active dialogue between state and non-state actors in the sector will be facilitated, leading to a regular exchange of experiences and interests in the design of the framework conditions for decentralised energy supply.  
Specific activities in this area may include: 
- Establish policy-business-dialogue between project developers, financiers and public institutions
- Facilitate the setting-up of “practitioners forum” for exchange of experience
- Provide technical and business training for local companies 
- Support technology and know-how transfer by linking to international/ regional rural electrification companies","Energy policy and administrative management(20.00%),Power generation/renewable sources(40.00%),Rural development(40.00%)",Energy and Electric Power Sector Coordination Group,Implementation,Bilateral,Project-type interventions,Grant,4000000,800000,4391557.4,841803.98,16,4391557.4,841803.98,4,Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit,Government of Germany| New Zealand Aid Programme,,Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit,"Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Irrigation",Nation-wide - 100.00%,,2016-03-01,2020-02-29,2016-03-01,,Mr Andrew Mark Hayton,09403995989,andrew.hayton@giz.de,,False,

The purpose of the Project is ""to uplift standard of living for rural communities and thereby contribute to socio-economic development of Myanmar”. The Project will be implemented under the following four components: (a) Formulation of the Master Plan on Saemaul Undong (including conducting baseline survey and developing national rural development policy); (b) Establishment of the Saemaul Undong Academy (including physical construction of the Academy in Nay Pyi Taw, developing education and training curriculum and materials, organizing training the trainers/community movement leaders); (c) Implementation of Pilot Saemaul Undong Model Villages (a total of 100 model villages to be selected by five different typologies of community environment such as dry zone, delta area, plain field, hill side, and sea side).

The key principles and added value of adopting the model of Saemaul Undong in driving income generation and sustainable rural development of Myanmar are as follows: (a) Emphasis on mindset and behaviour change first by infusing the spirit of self help and can-do attitude into people in rural communities; (b) Calling on strong leadership of, and committed support by, the Central Government by providing guidance, resources, and establishing systematic implementation mechanisms at the national, local and village levels; (c) Results-oriented and competition-driven approach to funding rural communities by providing collective incentives to better performed villages; and (d) Promotion of local ownership led by village leaders.

DK-1-5934,Improved Access to Quality Basic Education for the Hardest to Reach Children in Myanmar,"This support is part of the Thematic Programme within the Denmark-Myanmar Country Programme 2016-2020 focusing on Access to and Quality of Basic Education. Two focus areas have been selected to achieve the overall development objective of MEC: 

i.	Working in partnership with key service providers in ethnic and monastic education to strengthen the quality of education in these systems, both to enhance learning outcomes and to build an evidence base of how ethnic and monastic systems contribute to national education goals and as a basis for their recognition and accreditation.
ii.	To work in partnership with a broad base of education stakeholders to increase mutual understanding, dialogue and trust on key issues in ethnic and monastic education, to address various policy barriers and to create an enabling environment for the recognition and accreditation of ethnic and monastic education.
Under component (i) the ToC proposes a systems strengthening approach to improve retention and learning outcomes for children in ethnic and monastic schools . It has been widely internationally acknowledged that it is what actually happens in the classroom - with regard to a dynamic interaction of pedagogy, curriculum, language and formative assessment - that has a direct effect on learning outcomes . MEC will support strategies and actions that result in measurable changes in key aspects of classroom practice and teacher competencies. 

In line with the increasing international realisation that; “student achievement rarely exceeds the quality of a school’s leadership and management” , MEC will seek to support the achievement of ‘whole school’ approaches to school leadership, management and development, which ensure a conducive, inclusive environment for teaching and learning and that human, physical and financial resources are used, supported and managed effectively to promote improved and more equitable enrolment, retention and learning improvements. Underpinning quality classroom processes and effective schools are a range of interlocking sub-systems for teacher professional development, curriculum and materials development and supply, school leadership development and school support and supervision.  Successful education systems have strong and integrated processes for ongoing collection, use and management of data, including disaggregated participation metrics, quality information and learning outcomes data; which can in turn support effective planning, budgeting  monitoring, teacher deployment and resource allocation, to optimise educational outcomes, ensure equity by gender, social group and across socio-economic levels and to identify and address weaknesses. Many of MEC’s activities will therefore focus on achieving outputs related to strengthening critical aspects of these wider systems: those that are required in order to understand and address barriers to learning and ensure that schools and teachers can be effective. 

MEC will also look to link stakeholders in complementary education into national initiatives to improve school quality, for example initiatives in pedagogy, school clustering and school improvement planning, so they can benefit from these initiatives where possible and to work towards greater participation in decision making. MEC will further seek to promote collaboration and research across systems to allow sharing of learning and to support stakeholders to find common solutions to shared problems.
A technical argument alone is unlikely to be sufficient in an area that is politically sensitive. A stronger evidence base will need to be complemented by a more conducive policy environment if complementary schools are to receive greater recognition in the national system.

Under component (ii) a number of key policy and institutional constraints prevent ethnic and monastic schools providing a higher quality of education and constrain overall system coherence and effectiveness. These include the lack of accreditation and transfer systems, policies on language of instruction that give limited scope for mother-tongue based approaches, a top-down and inflexible curriculum model that constrains a locally-responsive approach and weaknesses in teacher management and deployment, as well as resource allocation mechanisms, which create disparity between schools and leave rural and ethnic areas under-served. 

The MEC approach will be based on the premise that education reform is a political process and that the outcomes will be a result of political negotiation with national interest groups.  Achieving changes in laws or directives alone is often insufficient to result in meaningful change. It is how these are disseminated and put into practice at local levels that will ultimately impact on whether a child has access to a relevant education. Achieving practical positive changes at a local level can be a more realistic objective than directly lobbying for change at a national level and, through increased dialogue and understanding, contribute to an environment where broader policy change is more feasible. 
MEC will therefore look to support a broad base of stakeholders in education to work towards a more inclusive policy environment with greater participation in decision making. This will require MEC sometimes playing a facilitative role or more direct engagement according to the situation.

This approach is designed to break down some of the barriers that currently exist to stronger dialogue and coordination between different education systems. By contributing to an environment of greater trust and collaboration, MEC aims to support stakeholders in education to address the key policy barriers and to support the transition to an education system where stakeholders in complementary education systems are able to participate in decision making and improve the overall effectiveness of the national education system.
In reality there will be a strong linkage between the two focus areas, as quality education services and the policy framework are mutually linked. MEC will support networking, technical assistance and research across different systems to promote both collaborative policy engagement and improvements in education services.

The strategy acknowledges that education reform is politically sensitive. The goals will not be achieved by MEC alone and the results, particularly in the area of policy dialogue, will be highly contingent on the broader political environment. MEC will adopt a flexible and responsive program design and work collaboratively with a broad base of stakeholders to respond to changes in the operating environment and respond to opportunities for dialogue and collaboration at national and local levels as they arise.","The overall objective of the programme is to support that complementary education systems provide the hardest to reach children with access to quality, accredited education and contribute to a coherent, inclusive national education system.","Education policy and administrative management(50.00%),Education facilities and training(10.00%),Teacher training(20.00%),Educational research(10.00%),Primary education(10.00%)",Education and TVET Sector Coordination Group,Implementation,Multilateral,Core contributions and pooled programmes and funds,Grant,40000000,13000000,6346994.8,2078176.23,4,6346994.8,2078176.23,2,Government of Denmark,Government of Denmark,Save the Children - Myanmar,Save the Children - Myanmar| XX - Local NGOs and Civil Society Groups,Ministry of Education,Kayin State - 33.34% | Kachin State - 33.33% | Mon State - 33.33%,,2017-03-01,2020-03-31,2017-09-28,,Erik Bentzen,+95 9974 766 504,erikbentzen@myanmareducationconsortium.org,,False,

Under this new strategy Myanmar and Australia will consider expanding to a third area in Myanmar, likely Shan state, where poverty, low productivity and lack of access to markets coincide.","ACIAR has developed a multidisciplinary program, in collaboration with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), and in consultation with Myanmar counterparts, donors and potential research providers.  This program supports the Myanmar Government’s goals on agricultural development and is consistent with Australia’s strategic objective on inclusive economic growth. Research priorities are:

- producing more food and increasing cash incomes of rural households in the Central Dry Zone and Ayeyarwady Delta through improving and adopting production and post-harvest technologies in agriculture, including livestock and fisheries;
- building capacity for agriculture, livestock and fisheries research development and extension through program activities, and post-graduate and short-term training; and
- providing technical assistance and advice to relevant GOM departments for policy strengthening.

Future research priorities to be funded by ACIAR directly (as opposed to with DFAT funding) will be:

- develop a sustainable pro-poor beef industry and policy
- produce grain legumes, including breeding and mechanised harvesting of mungbean
diversify and intensify rice-based cropping systems to increase overall productivity and farm income
- land evaluation and resource management will improve planning and management for productive and resilient landscapes
- develop smallholder and community aquaculture, and better manage the Ayeyarwady River and Delta fisheries

DK-1-6602,Denmark's Support for Capacity Development Fund (CDF),"In reviewing the capacity development achievements over the last year the Myanmar Ministry of Education (MOE) has identified two urgent challenges that need to be immediately addressed in order to realise more effective, efficient and sustainable capacity development across the education sector. Firstly, the MOE lacks a systematic approach to capacity building of Ministry systems, procedures and human resources that will realise greater effectiveness and efficiencies over the long term. Secondly, the MOE lacks the institutional structures needed to resource and enable a sustained focus on capacity development over the remaining four years of the National Education Strategic Plan. These two high-level challenges are informed by the following strategic challenges facing capacity development in the MOE. 

What is clear from the challenges and lessons learned to date is that the MOE needs to put in place effective temporary mechanisms, namely a Capacity Development Team and linked Capacity Development Fund (CDF), to focus attention on and resource sector-wide capacity development to support NESP implementation. Without these mechanisms in place measurable and sustained improvements in capacity development at national and sub-national levels will be much harder to achieve. These two mechanisms are briefly outlined below. 

The MOE will establish a transparent, cost-effective, responsive and flexible Capacity Development Fund (CDF) under the Office of the Union Minister. CDF will be a temporary mechanism established by the MOE covering the remaining four years of the NESP. At the end of this period it is anticipated that the CDF will have strengthened human resource capacities and systems to the level that the fund will no longer be needed. The CDF will be jointly funded by the MOE and development partners .
 
The Capacity Development Fund (CDF) will be a key structure to enable the MOE to undertake systematic, sector-wide and Department-based capacity building of systems, procedures and human resources. As the Capacity Development Team (CDT) is an integral part of CDF this structure is an important focus of the following proposal.

CDF will be able to support implementation of all government and development partner funded programmes through directly addressing unfunded and/or priority capacity development priorities identified by each Department. 

Establishment of CDF is urgent for the MOE as it wants to strengthen existing systems, procedures and human resources capabilities over the next 12 months in order to prepare for a dramatic increase in government and development partner funding expected in the 2018-19 financial year, i.e. year 3 of the NESP .","1.	The capacity of senior managers to undertake continuous strategic analysis of NESP implementation in order to achieve the NESP Goal and 9 Transformational Shifts is enhanced;

2.	The effectiveness of existing systems and procedures at national and sub-national levels is strengthened; and,

3.	The capacity of NESP Secretariat officers, Department Programme Management Teams, and State/Region Education officers in the efficient and effective implementation of NESP programmes is developed.","Education policy and administrative management(30.00%),Education facilities and training(50.00%),Educational research(20.00%)",Education and TVET Sector Coordination Group,Implementation,Bilateral,Project-type interventions,Loan,20000000,11200000,3173497.4,1790428.75,4,3173497.4,1790428.75,2,Government of Denmark,Government of Denmark,Ministry of Education,Ministry of Education,Ministry of Education,Nation-wide - 100.00%,,2018-02-01,2020-12-31,2018-02-01,,Jonathan Caseley,n/a,jonathancaseley@gmail.com,,False,

Under the SGP Programme, a total sum of EUR 11.6 million is invested. 10 million EUR are provided by the German Government through KfW and EUR 1.6 million by the ACB. The project partner is the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation. 

The SGP includes two components. Firstly the national component aims at supporting communities and NGOs in and around AHPs. Appropriate measures for biodiversity conservation and improved living conditions of the people in and around AHPs are funded. Local structures are strengthened. The second component covers regional coordination and strengthening of the ACB. 

The target of the Small Grants Programme is to improve biodiversity protection in and around ASEAN Heritage Parks (AHPs), to improve the livelihood of local communities and to strengthen the role of ASEAN Centre for Biodiversity (ACB) in promoting biodiversity protection among the ASEAN member states. Within the programme local communities, park management and NGOs can apply for small grants for activities regarding biodiversity protection and livelihood improvement of local communities. So far, the two INGOs, Fauna & Flora International + Wildlife Conservation Society have been selected to implement this programme.

In Myanmar, small grants are utilised in and around four ASEAN Heritage Parks (Meinmahla Kyun Wildlife Sanctuary, Alaungdaw Kathapa Wildlife Sanctuary, Nat Ma Taung National Park and Indawgyi Lake Wildlife Sanctuary).",Bio-diversity,Environmental Conservation Sector Coordination Group,Implementation,Bilateral,Core contributions and pooled programmes and funds,Grant,2000000,50000,2669831.3,60497.31,4,2669831.3,60497.31,2,KfW Entwicklungsbank,Government of Germany,KfW Entwicklungsbank,Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation| KfW Entwicklungsbank,Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation,Ayeyarwady Region - 25.00% | Kachin State - 25.00% | Chin State - 25.00% | Sagaing Region - 25.00%,Bogale - 25.00% | Mingin - 25.00% | Mohnyin - 25.00%,2014-09-24,2019-09-23,2014-09-24,,Mr. Adrian Klocke,+49 69 7431 8641,adrian.klocke@kfw.de,,False,

While it is not possible for UNICEF alone to address wider planning and budgeting/PFM challenges, it can make a strategic contribution through focused and strategic efforts, advocacy and partnerships in 3 areas: a) further analysis and assessment(s) on the decomposition and trends of social sector budgets (health, education, social welfare); b) Continued strengthening of MSWRR’s planning and budgeting capacities to increase its ability to effectively, efficiently and equitably implement key programmes that reduce child poverty and inequities; and c) technical support to States/Regions in helping strengthen their ability to undertake sub-national planning that is more evidence based (also linking to efforts on producing quality sub-national data on children as part of Output 1) and equity sensitive, in collaboration with other UN agencies and development partners also supporting broader local planning approaches. Assumptions: Disaggregated expenditure data (e.g. World Bank’s BOOST database) is publicly available to enable child-focused analyses and advocacy; States/Region governments receive increasing administrative and fiscal responsibilities; the government’s overall PFM reforms continue – in order to maintain the interest and direction for line ministries to improve their PFM.","By 2022, there is improved evidence, capacity and systems for equity sensitive planning, budgeting and implementation",Multisector aid for basic social services,Social Protection and Disaster Management Sector Coordination Group,Implementation,Multilateral,Project-type interventions,Grant,308791.11,276822.09,308791.11,276822.09,25,308791.11,276822.09,5,United Nations Children's Fund,UNICEF Core Resources,United Nations Children's Fund,United Nations Children's Fund,"Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement| Ministry of Health and Sports| Ministry of Planning and Finance",Nation-wide - 100.00%,,2018-01-01,2022-12-31,2018-01-01,,Paul Edwards,Tel: +95 (0) 1230 5960-5969 ext 1427,pedwards@unicef.org,,False,

MM-FERD-ID1117,Strengthening the National Quality Infrastructure for Trade in the Republic of the Union of Myanmar,"The National Quality Infrastructure (NQI) in Myanmar is underdeveloped and lacks the capacity required for a modern economy with food supply chains integrated into global food supply chains. With the exception of some food testing laboratories, there has been little investment in equipment and facilities in the last 30 years and this has in turn limited 
technical capacity building. The weakness in the NQI acts as a constraint on trade and export led growth. It also acts as a constraint on the development of value added food products and the diversification of food products and markets. This intervention is designed to address these weaknesses. 
Existing capacity will be strengthened in four key food testing laboratories and training will also be provided to meet the requirements for  accreditation to ISO 17025 for some key testing parameters. The MFPEA’s Food Industries Development Supporting Laboratory (FIDSL) will receive the bulk of support in terms of equipment as its mandate is to provide testing services to MFPEA members and it is in the best position to rapidly extend its range of testing services to exporters with support from this intervention. The cost accounting system in all the key food testing laboratories strengthened to international standards and support will be provided for business plan development. 

On the job training will be provided to the Standards Department in the Myanmar Scientific and Technological Research Development (MSTRD), MoST, to manage the standardization process and build capacity in standards development. This will include assistance to prepare a Medium to Long Term Plan for strengthening Standardization in Myanmar and the development of the Standards Department as a National Standards Body (NSB). 
 
The Standards Department in the MSTRD will be supported with equipment and technical training to upgrade their calibration laboratory for mass and temperature. TA will be provided to strengthen inspection procedure for food by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the Ministry of Health (MoH) and the Myanmar Testing and Inspection Services  (MITS). In parallel MITS will be assisted to assess its feasibility for accreditation as an inspection body, and if feasible, a Road Map will be prepared. The Standards Department and MITS will be assisted to prepare a Road Map for the accreditation as a Certification Body.

FSSC 22000 – Food Safety System Certification Scheme. Implementation and certification will seek to promote the adoption of the highest standards in food safety risk management by initiating a pilot program to support at least 10 small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) for certification to FSSC 22000. This scheme is a common requirement for participation in the global food supply chain of multiple retailers in the EU, USA and increasingly in Asia. This will build on an existing base of 12 large food processors that are certified to ISO 22000. A core group of national consultants and public food inspectors will be trained in implementation of food safety risk management systems.

DK-1-4583,"Support to Lessons Learnt Project regarding the Advisory
Commission on Rakhine State","The Advisory Commission on Rakhine State was convened in September 2016 and tasked with providing recommendations to the government of Myanmar to achieve lasting peace in Rakhine State. A joint initiative of the Office of the State Counsellor of Myanmar and the Kofi Annan Foundation, the Commission was composed of six local and three international experts, and chaired by Kofi Annan. A small office in Yangon was established to support the Commission in the pursuit of its mandate.

Over the following twelve months the Commissioners held over 150 consultations and dialogues with stakeholders at the regional, national and state level, including all communities in Rakhine. It held meetings in Yangon and Naypyitaw, Indonesia, Thailand, Bangladesh, and Geneva. In March 2017 the Commission issued an interim report containing recommendations that could be readily implemented following the attacks in October on members of the security forces, to address the resulting deterioration of the security of communities in Rakhine and increase in intercomunal tensions. In August 2017 the Commission produced its final report which addressed in depth a broad range of structural issues impeding peace and prosperity in Rakhine State. The report was widely welcomed by the government, which pledged to act quickly to implement its recommendations, and while the military expressed some concerns regarding nomenclature and the historical narrative presented in the report, they did not fundamentally object to any specific recommendations.

The final report of the Commission was also endorse by a range of international actors, including the UN, the EU and the US. Various actors have offered to support the Government of Myanmar with its implementation of the recommendations, including both technical and financial support. On 12 September 2017, the Government established the ""Committee to Implement the Recommendations on Rakhine State."" Chaired by the Union Minister for Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement, the committee will oversee implementation of the recommendations of the Advisory Commission, as well as those proposed by the national investigation Commission Chaired by the Vice President. The Committee will be supported in its work by an Advisory Group. The composition and Terms of Reference of this group has not yet been announced, but it will include international members.

Case for a lessons learnt project

Several aspects of the Commission, including its mixed composition, its establishment as a joint initiative between the Office of the State Counsellor and a foreign Foundation, are unique. It represented an innovative approach to peace building in a country undergoing a challenging national peace and reconciliation process. The Commission managed to work cohesively, despite its heterogeneous composition and all commissioners agreed on both the interim and the final report. The Commission's two reports —which provided a progressive and constructive roadmap to peace, development and inter-communal cohesion in Rakhine —were widely welcomed by various key actors, including the Myanmar government and the vast majority of international partners. The government pledged to implement the Commission's recommendations.

Despite these positive developments, the situation on the ground in Rakhine deteriorated sharply immediately after the release of the Commission's final report in August 2017. Attacks by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) on government security forces were followed by a comprehensive clearance operation by the security forces. According to available information, more than half a million Muslims have fled Rakhine since 25 August 2017, and numerous villages have been burnt to the ground. There have been numerous reports of serious human rights violations carried out by security forces and Rakhine vigilante groups.

The lessons from the Commission's work could be of use and interest to other peace processes beyond Myanmar. The Kofi Annan Foundation now seeks to document and analyse these lessons in a way that is accessible and instructive for policy makers, academics, and practitioners alike.","The objective of the development cooperation is to support the lessons learnt project regarding the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State.

The lessons from the Commission's work could be of use and interest to other peace processes beyond Myanmar. The Kofi Annan Foundation will document and analyse the lessons. The lessons learnt report will mainly capture and reflect the expectations of the impact of the Commission amongst relevant stakeholders and actors; identify and highlight the challenges encountered by the Commission members in the pursuit of their mandate as well as the diplomatic and political approaches used to overcome them; and highlight the strength and weakness of the Commission’s mandate, structure and methodology; etc. The report will be launched at a seminar in Copenhagen in 2018.",Participation in international peacekeeping operations,Joint Coordination Body for Peace Process Funding,Implementation,Bilateral,Project-type interventions,Grant,2000000,2000000,319903.78,317974.18,4,319903.78,317974.18,2,Government of Denmark,Government of Denmark,,Kofi Annan Foundation,Myanmar Peace Centre,Rakhine State - 100.00%,,2017-11-27,2018-12-31,2017-11-27,,Dorte Chortsen,+95 (1) 538717,dorcho@um.dk,,False,

The last three years have brought substantive political progress to a country which for too long experienced very little of the democratization, however slow, experienced by many of its neighbors. The upcoming General Elections will be a significant test of the government’s commitment to the reform process they’ve put into place and to the changes they promise are still coming. 
Because this will be the first complete electoral process of its kind in 20 years to include all major parties, electoral competition among local politicians and powerbrokers where elections are taking place could be fiercer than in 2010. Because the National League for Democracy and a number of other ethnic political parties, including possibly Kachin based parties would be competing for the first time in a complete electoral exercise since the elections in 1990, elections for the 440 seats up for grabs will be a litmus test for the country and an indicator of the possible direction of the country after the next general election. The NLD’s participation in the April 1 2012 by-elections was in many ways a clear signal of the changes that were to follow as it meant that Aung San Suu Kyi has been allowed to compete for a seat, which was a significant change from 2010. Following on from the achievements made from the April 1 2012 by-elections it now remains to be seen whether the 2015 elections will foster the growth of parliamentary governance as is practiced in healthy democracies and also create the much needed space to expand on the gains made so far since the opening of the country.","To assess the conduct of elections and make an impartial reporting on Myanmar’s 2015 General Elections through deploying an international election observation mission, and to burst the confident of national electoral stakeholder for a better and transparency performance in implement the electoral activities.","Government and civil society, general",None,Completion,Bilateral,Core contributions and pooled programmes and funds,Grant,275000,250000,275000,250000,4,275000,250000,2,Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation,Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation,,Norwegian People's Aid,Union Election Commission,Nation-wide - 100.00%,,2015-09-01,2016-03-31,2015-09-01,2016-03-31,U Thet Win Aung,"+ 95 1 534754, 512173",thet.win.aung@eda.admin.ch,,False,

In order to facilitate the management of NES implementation, the Myanmar Trade Development Committee, composed of public and private stakeholders, has been established with the assistance of ITC. The MTDC is supported by an Executive Secretariat.  The NES was launched in March 2015, marking the start of the implementation phase.

Despite recent relaxations in media censorship, such as the unblocking of exile and international news websites, the Burmese media sector remains highly beholden to state sanctions and the interests of the security sector. Censorship, in short, remains a reality in the Burmese press. Sitting members of the Burmese cabinet are on record as stating there continues to be a need for the government to be a critical player in the media environment. Moreover, the mushrooming of independent news sources in the country in many cases involves personnel linked to the government and security sectors. Finally, despite recent by-election victories by opposition candidates, the Burmese government remains overwhelmingly dominated by a single, military-backed party, while the armed forces themselves continue to hold a mandated 25 per cent of all legislative seats.If Burma's democratic transition is to prove successful, issues impacting the role, behavior and governance of media must be addressed.

MM-FERD-ID2883,Transition Monitoring in Support of 2015 Elections,"The Carter Center was invited by the Government of Myanmar to establish a presence to prepare for the eventual deployment of an international election observation mission in advance of the 2015 elections. The Carter Center’s in-country field presence will evolve over four phases of project activities. In the first phase, the Center deployed a mission consisting of four Long-Term Observers to assess the pre-election and political transition environment and to lay the groundwork for future observation work in six states and regions; Ye (Mon), Shadaw and Demoso (Kayah), and Hsihseng (Shan), Ayeyarwady, Mandalay and eastern Shan State. The areas of focus for the assessment have included: 1) Evaluating the Impartiality and Capacity of Government and Electoral Institutions; 2) Assessing Pre-Election Political Space; 3) Identifying Vulnerable Constituencies and Electoral Risks; 4) Sensitizing Local Actors to Election Observation. 
The long-term observer field teams report regularly to the office in Yangon. A detailed profile will be produced for each of the six states and regions visited, including baseline data and analysis, as well as logistics and security information, to support operational planning for future long and short-term observation missions. The mission will also produce an overall preliminary analysis of the legal and regulatory framework for elections. The Center also conducts regular briefings with a range of government, political party, and civil society stakeholders on the need for a rights-based approached to elections, as well as the benefits of international and domestic election observation.
In Phase Two, Carter Centre would expand the Phase One deployment through August 2015 and double the number of long-term observer teams. The mission would continue and advance the work done in the first phase for an additional five months. The mission plans to conduct State and Region assessments in Magway, Rakhine, Thanintharyi, Bago, Sagain, Chin, Kachin and northern Shan States. The Center will seek long-term observer accreditation once the UEC finalizes the related procedures.
Phase Three (August – December 2015) will commence after elections are formally called, when the mission will transform to a full election observation mission, with an extended deployment of long-term observer teams and electoral experts. The Carter Center will deploy a short-term observer delegation to observe at polling stations throughout the country. The election observation mission will monitor a range of issues on the basis of international democratic election standards and adherence to national law. The observation mission will release periodic statements on the conduct of the elections as well as a comprehensive final report with recommendations.
The Center plans to continue its work in Phase Four with a limited presence through 2016 to continue transition monitoring, support UEC and government efforts to implement recommendations made during previous phases, and conduct workshops for election officials and civil society to increase understanding of democratic election standards.","The overall purpose of this project is to improve the electoral and the political transition process in Myanmar through field-based monitoring and public reporting on key conditions for a fair electoral process, including as regards freedom of expression, freedom of association, voting rights, observer access, and impartial, effective election management bodies.

MM-FERD-ID9267,Safeguarding Myanmar Marionette Performance art,"Myanmar is enriched with a great diversity of cultural forms including fine and performing arts, which have their own specific features of painting, music, sculpture, wood carving, dance and dramas. One of the most characteristic and famous forms of performing arts is the Myanmar marionette Theatre performance, called ""Yoke-Thay Pwe"" in Myanmar language. The Myanmar marionettes Theatre together with Myanmar Traditional Orchestra, throughout its history, has built a reputation of reviving some of the ancient cultural traditions. The next logical step is to develop its capacity to preserve this art for future generations.
In the past, Myanmar puppetry, an art held in much esteem by all classes, was not only for entertainment. Marionettes were also a means of making people aware of current events, a medium for educating the people in literature, history and religion, display of lifestyles and customs. Nowadays, the 'old traditional artist marionette generation' has almost faded away. This is simply due to the lack of patronage required during the last few decades. As a consequence and together with the advance of modern entertainment the art of marionette is rapidly disappearing and is often referred to as dying art. The same story is applicable to the artists.
It is therefore an urgent need not only in promoting, safeguarding and extending the Myanmar marionettes history but also seeking ways to improve learning and teaching within the traditional theatrical performing artist communities.","The project aims to safeguard and promote all aspects of traditional Myanmar marionettes and performing arts which include manipulating Myanmar marionette (puppet), dancing, music, sculpture, sequin embroidery and painting, so as to contribute to sustainability of social and economic development in Myanmar.",Tourism policy and administrative management,Environmental Conservation Sector Coordination Group,Completion,Bilateral,Budget support,Grant,117708,117708,117708,117708,9,117708,117708,3,Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation,Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation,,Myanmar Upper Land Cultural,Ministry of Hotels & Tourism,Nation-wide - 100.00%,,2015-07-01,2016-06-30,2015-07-01,2016-06-30,U Nay Myo Zaw,+95 1 534754,<Nay.Myo.Zaw@eda.admin.ch>,,False,

Through the dissemination of information about and impacting women in all spheres of life such as GBV, political leadership, women’s rights and gender equality including health, culture, education and sports, this project will facilitate the empowerment and appreciation of women in Myanmar during the country’s ongoing transition to democracy and respect for fundamental rights.","We anticipate the above dissemination of information to contribute toward a higher profile of women in the peace process and in positions of decision-making, a better understanding of the capability of women in all spheres of life, a better understanding regarding gender equality, GBV issues and domestic and international laws dealing with women, and strengthening advocacy for policymakers to adopt legislation consistent with the aims of gender equality, etc.

Accordingly, this project will realize the following product concerning women in Myanmar society: a weekly television program. This 20-minute program, “Women in Myanmar Society”, will air on the country’s national broadcaster Myanma Radio and Television (MRTV) television for the first 6 months of the project period and Mizzima’s digital TV channel (newly granted and planned to be launched by November 2017) for the remainder of the project period. The program will also be broadcast through Mizzima’s websites (www.mizzima.tv and www.mizzimaburmese.com) and Facebook. In all, from May 2017 to April 2018 we will produce and broadcast, nationwide, 48 episodes “Women in Myanmar Society”. 

Programming will range from current news stories to interviews to profiles to more of a dialogue format. With respect to the latter, we will invite experts and guests representing a range of views and professions to engage in a lively exchange on matters critical to Myanmar’s ongoing transition and specifically to the role of women in the search for peace and security in Myanmar. 

Regular voices on the TV program will include but are not limited to: prominent female voices, voices from women in general, political party representatives, lawyers, businesspersons, CSOs, academics, government representatives, youth and professionals in relevant fields to the topic of the day. Besides strict attention to raising the voice of women and women’s issues regarding the search for peace, the program will also prioritize the ethnic dimension to the subject matter. 

The product will include authoritative and domestic voices on the particular subjects, providing viewers with an opportunity to interact and communicate with others impacted and concerned with issues at the heart of women’s contribution for peace building in Myanmar society. Primary media production will focus on ethnic women’s activities in conflict-affected areas in ethnic states (Kachin, Kayah, Karen, Chin, Mon, Rakhine and Shan States). The primary targeted audiences are the stakeholders (both men and women) who are involved in policy and decision-making, women viewers andthe general public with access to MRTV and Mizzima’s multimedia platforms.

MRTV is the country’s more than 70-year old national broadcaster and its transmission covers more than 90% of the country.

The 2015 elections will be also land mark in the country's ongoing democratic transition and will be heavily scrutinized. UEC has already announced that the election will be held on 08th November and Myanmar democratic icon, ASSK and her party has decided to participate in election. Elections are planned to take place for national parliament and also the 14 region/state-level parliaments and ethnic nationality representatives in approximately 47,000 polling stations around the country. This year will be the first time in 25 years that a majority of the voting population will be casting a vote in election which is closely contested between parties and there are high expectations amongst voters that election which is closely contested between parties and there are high expectations amongst voters that elections will be free and fair. The successful conducts of 2015 elections are important for the success of Myanmar's ongoing transition and peace process.
Without a history of multi-party elections, Myanmar lacks the experience in handling many issues around elections; political parties, media and civil society have little experience of election contests. Such circumstances can lead to misinformation and misconceptions, especially during the campaign period, that can be a factor in the number of electoral disputes. Perceptions of irregularities and allegations of fraud-especially where alleged frauds are documented by observers or media - can be inflamed by the increasingly active social media and contribute to a wider atmosphere of uncertainty and tension.
The Union Election Commission (UEC)was formed in 2010 and the commission members were formally appointed by previous military government. UEC is being criticized by various advocacy groups and political parties for impartiality since the current chairman is also ex-military general and ex-member of USDP. Despite Union Election Commission is improving itself in many areas in terms of consultation with civil society organizations, political parties and following international standards and guidelines, confidence on UEC among citizens is still insignificant and the credibility of elections are very much relying on what extent UEC will prepare the process in transparent and accountable manner.","The general objective of the Small Action is to support UEC to hold credible and transparent the 2015 General Elections through the support for provision of Indelible Ink. Switzerland's contribution to this support will also help building confidence in the process, prevent multiple voting and mitigate any perception of fraud that can facilitate peaceful democratic transition by mitigating post election conflicts associated with electoral irregularities and vote rigging.","Government and civil society, general",None,Completion,Bilateral,Core contributions and pooled programmes and funds,Grant,150000,150000,154590.41,154231.18,4,154590.41,154231.18,2,Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation,Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation,,United Nations Development Programme,Union Election Commission,Nation-wide - 100.00%,,2015-09-11,2015-12-31,2015-09-11,2015-12-31,U Thet Win Aung,+ 95 1 534754,thet.win.aung@eda.admin.ch,,False,

In a response, the Myanmar government has embarked on an ambitious programme of political, social and economic change. Restarting (industrial) development is just one of the many challenges, which is needed as engine for income and job creation. Thus when managed well and sustainably, economic growth can result in widespread progress encouraging an inclusive, multi-ethnic and prosperous society, taking advantage of its location and diversity in both natural and human resources. 
However, the environment has never been a significant government concern reflected in Myanmar’s lack of experience with cleaner production and resource efficiency. This changed, when Myanmar agreed to the Manila Green Industry Declaration, which was prepared by UNIDO and United Nation Environmental Program (UNEP)in 2009 at the Green Industry Conference. Based on the Manila agreement, the Myanmar government requested UNIDO’s support in its implementation as well as to access and benefit from UNIDO’s extensive international knowledge and experiences under the global RECP program. Another positive note for the implementation of RECP is that the Department of Environmental Conservation was established in 2012now under the Ministry of Environmental Conservation and Forests (MECAF).
The SECO-supported programme by UNIDO described here offers a potential for introducing innovative approaches to RECP in Myanmar and move from demonstration of benefits at the company level towards widespread sector-wide replication through peer-learning in order to achieve national-level economic, social, and environmental benefits.
The RECP Programme in Myanmar is incorporating a market strategy targeted to simultaneously build-up demand and supply for RECP services. A network comprising government institutions, private sector and civil society will therefore be encouraged. The introductory dialogues/workshops will be organized to share and learn from good practices from different thematic areas in terms of water, energy chemicals, materials, waste and emissions. The RECP implementation and network will be supported by the Division of Energy Efficiency & Conservation under the Ministry of Industry (MOI) and a dedicated technical team from UNIDO. 
The pilot program is furthermore structured to provide basic and advance knowledge of RECP through training/workshops on related subjects including on the following: Environmental Management System (EMS), Environmental Management Accounting (EMA), under ISO guidance now referred to a Material Flow Cost Accounting, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), and Sustainable Product Innovation/ Design for Sustainability (D4S). It will also strengthen RECP capacity and network; increase implementation of RECP method and practices by enterprises, creating human capacity/expertise and improving policy and framework related to industry, and promote appropriate financial instruments for RECP investments in targeted enterprises.","Myanmar is a resource rich country with an estimated population of 60 million (2010), ranked among the least developed economies in the world with a GDP per capital of USD 845.

On behalf of the Yangon Regional Government, Turquoise Mountain is completing the restoration of the Myanmar Aswe building and bringing it back into use as a public asset by mid-2019.

The Myanmar Aswe project is a ready training ground with international conservation and construction specialists directly overseeing training and standards. Around 75% of the construction workers on the Myanmar Aswe project are internal migrants that have moved to Yangon within the past year to find work and for sending back remittances to their families. The contractor provides accommodation and transport for these workers, and through the proposed training programme, they can learn skills that enable them to create livelihoods and better support themselves and their families.

This support is part of SDC’s ‘culture for development’ programme. It seeks to strengthen the preservation and revitalisation of architectural heritage in Yangon, by supporting the relevant crafts and skills required in the construction sector.
The support of the Myanmar Answe Project will allow a meaningful contribution to i) strengthening an industry focused on the preservation of Yangon’s architectural heritage, ii) the restauration of an important piece of Myanmar cultural heritage and iii) the up-skilling and improvement of the livelihoods of construction workers and their families, many of which are from disadvantaged and/or migrant backgrounds.","The project aims to up-skill construction workers in a sub-sector of the construction sector that requires a specific set of additional skills and will provide comparative employment advantages to disadvantaged workers.

DK-1-2975,Support to The Study of the United Nations Secretary-General's Good Offices on Myanmar,"The UN Secretary-General, through his ‘Good Offices’, has played a key role in the international community’s response to Myanmar’s internal conflicts since the early 1990s. This role has been mandated by UN member states in annual UNGA resolutions on Myanmar (1993-2015, 2017) and has been implemented, primarily, by a succession of special envoys/advisers. 

The earlier phases of the Good Offices were detailed and evaluated in a monograph authored by the lead researchers on the present project and published by the International Peace Institute: Anna Magnusson (aka Sofia Busch) and Morten B. Pedersen, A Good Office? Twenty Years of UN Mediation in Myanmar (New York: IPI, 2012). There has, however, been no in-depth analysis of the latest period under UNSG Ban Ki-moon and his Special Adviser on Myanmar, Vijay Nambiar (2010-2016). Little information is publicly available about the activities undertaken under the Good Offices during this time, how these were received locally in Myanmar, or what impact they had on political developments there. This leaves a major gap in the understanding of a key international policy instrument, even as UNSG António Guterres prepares to appoint a new special envoy. Such analysis lacking, there’s a great risk that mistakes will be made, opportunities missed, and unrealistic expectations held in the next phase.

Improved knowledge and understanding of UN mediation in Myanmar from 2010-2016 is critically important for the UN and its member states, as well as the main actors inside Myanmar and the broader policy community, for several reasons: 

First, this period (2012-2016) has seen major changes in both the Myanmar and international political landscape, presenting new opportunities and challenges for the Good Offices. Lessons learned from earlier periods are therefore less likely to apply in any direct form and need to be revisited in light of the developing situation. 

Secondly, after significant progress on national reconciliation in the earlier part of this period, new crises have developed that now threaten to derail the overall transition toward peace, democracy and broad-based development. This has significantly raised the stakes involved for everyone concerned with the future of Myanmar and put a premium on informed policy debate in the months and years ahead.

Thirdly, while the UN – including, but not limited to the UNSG’s Good Offices – has faced unprecedented criticism for its handling of these new crises, both from within and outside the organisation, there has been little attempt so far to fully and systematically consider whether alternative strategies were available at the time – or are available moving forward.

This project aims to strengthen UN mediation in Myanmar’s internal conflicts in the years ahead by improving knowledge, understanding and debate about past efforts, specifically the efforts of UNSG Ban Ki-Moon and his Special Adviser on Myanmar, Vijay Nambiar, from 2010-16. This will be achieved by undertaking – and disseminating – a detailed and in-depth analysis of the UNSG’s Good Offices during this period, including how it was conceived and executed, how it fitted within the broader policies of the UN and its member states, how it was received within Myanmar and affected the home-grown effort of national reconciliation, and what lessons can be learned for future UN mediation in Myanmar (and beyond).","The overall objective of the project is to contribute to peace and reconciliation in Myanmar by improving knowledge and understanding of the UNSG’s Good Offices from 2010-16 and promoting informed reflection and debate within the UN, as well as among Myanmar actors and the broader international policy community, about international engagement in Myanmar.",Participation in international peacekeeping operations,Joint Coordination Body for Peace Process Funding,Implementation,Bilateral,Project-type interventions,Grant,400000,200000,66943.89,33204,4,66943.89,33204,2,Government of Denmark,Government of Denmark,,XX - Local NGOs and Civil Society Groups,Myanmar Peace Centre,Nation-wide - 100.00%,,2018-03-01,2018-12-31,2018-03-01,,U Thant House Trust,+95-9775726717,sofia.uthanthouse@gmail.com,,False,
